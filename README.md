# Polished-Tkinter-Projects
This repository contains all the tkinter projects I have made. They contain a responsive polished ui.

## Miles to Kilometers Converter (`miles_to_kms.py`)

This project is a simple, polished GUI application built with [ttkbootstrap](https://ttkbootstrap.readthedocs.io/) (an enhanced theming library for Tkinter) that converts distances from miles to kilometers.

### Features
- Modern, themed user interface using ttkbootstrap
- Input field for miles
- Button to perform the conversion
- Output label displaying the result in kilometers
- Handles invalid input gracefully

### How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended).
2. Install the `ttkbootstrap` package if you don't have it:
   ```bash
   pip install ttkbootstrap
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python miles_to_kms.py
   ```

### Usage
- Enter a value in miles in the input field.
- Click the "Convert" button.
- The equivalent distance in kilometers will be displayed below.

### Example
If you enter `5` and click Convert, the output will be:
```
Kilometers: 8.05
```
